						<h3 class="section-headings">About Thomas</h3>
						<p>A native Charlestonian, Thomas grew up downtown and spent summers on Sullivan’s Island. He
							graduated from Porter-Gaud. He attended the University of South Carolina on an Alumni
							Scholarship and graduated with a B.A. in Political Science in 1989. While in school he worked
							as a page in the South Carolina House of Representatives for the late Ted Mappus, served as an
							intern in the Office of the President for the University and was Chief of Staff to the President of
							the Student Government Association.<br><br>
							Thomas graduated from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1992 and returned to
							Charleston, purchasing his first home in Byrnes Down.<br><br>
							Thomas married Elizabeth Condon Pritchard in 1996, and they purchased a home on Betsy’s
							native James Island in 1998. Together, they raised three wonderful and accomplished children,
							Sarah (25), Thomas (25) and Harrison (21) in the home where Betsy and Thomas still reside.</p>

								<h3 class="section-headings">Career</h3>
								<p>After graduating from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1992, Thomas returned
									to Charleston and had the honor and privilege of spending a year serving as law clerk to the late
									Honorable William L. Howard, Sr., Resident Judge, Ninth Judicial Circuit. Thereafter, he
									became an associate at Barnwell, Whaley, Patterson &amp; Helms, eventually rising to the rank of
									partner. In 2006, he established the firm of Pritchard &amp; Elliott, with his brother, Edward, and
									close friend and partner at Barnwell, Whaley, James Elliott. He remained with Pritchard &amp;
									Elliott, and its successor, Pritchard Law Group, until 2017, when he set out on a new adventure
									with Parker Nelson &amp; Associates.<br><br>
									In 2022, Thomas became the managing attorney for Vernis &amp; Bowling of South Carolina, a
									Florida-based firm with eighteen offices in six states. He opened a Charleston office on
									Savannah Highway in West Ashley. He manages a very active insurance defense and worker’s
									compensation defense practice throughout the State and is excited about the growth trajectory of
									the firm in South Carolina.<br><br>
									He has been a certified circuit court mediator since 2011. He is admitted to practice in the State
									of South Carolina (1992), United States District Court for the District of South Carolina (1993),
									and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (1994). He belongs to the
									Charleston County Bar, the South Carolina Bar, the Claims and Legal Management Alliance, and
									the National Retail &amp; Restaurant Defense Association.</p>

								<h3 class="section-headings">Political Experience</h3>
								<p>In 1999, Thomas felt it was time to start giving back to a community that had given him and so
									many generations of his family before him such incredible opportunities and enjoyment. He was
									first elected to the Board of Commissioners for the City of Charleston Commissioner of Public
									Works (CPW or CWS) in November of 1999, to serve a six-year term commencing in January of
									2000. Since that time, he has had both the pleasure and privilege of serving the citizens of
									Charleston and the greater Lowcountry region for almost twenty-four years. He has been
									Chairman of the Board since 2006, which has afforded him the opportunity to work with an
									incredible team of managers and associates as well as fellow commissioners.<br><br>
									Since Thomas joined the Board, CWS has established or renewed long-term water and/or
									sanitary sewer service contracts with Mt. Pleasant, North Charleston, St. John’s Water, Folly
									Beach, James Island PSD, and many others. The operation of CWS truly takes both a regional
									vision and regional cooperation.
									<h3 class="campaign-slogan-alt">Proven, responsible leadership.</h3>
									In his time there, Charleston Water has received two bond rating increases, being upgraded from AA
									to AA+ in 2001 and from AA+ to AAA in 2009, maintaining the AAA rating through fourteen
									consecutive ratings reviews. Charleston Water is one of only a handful of combined water and
									wastewater utilities in the County to enjoy an AAA rating. This results in significant cost
									saving to the rate payors when Charleston Water goes to the bond market to borrow to fund
									capital projects.<br><br>
									Thomas has spurned a number of opportunities and entreaties from other community leaders
									over the years to seek higher office. He feels strongly that he can best continue to serve the
									citizens of Charleston and the Lowcountry by continuing to apply his knowledge and expertise to
									service on the Board of CWS.</p>
