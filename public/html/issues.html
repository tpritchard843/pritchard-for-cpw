						<h3 class="section-headings">Balanced Development & Smart Growth</h3>
						<p>Charleston Water System is legally obligated to serve all areas within the City of Charleston,
              with certain rare exceptions, and contractually obligated to serve certain other areas within the
              region. However, the Board and staff at CWS during my years of service has fully recognized
              the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) and is committed to not expanding its footprint outside of
              the UGB. During my seventeen-plus years as Chairman, the Board has consistently reaffirmed
              our commitment to recognition of the UGB. I view the strict adherence to the UGB as one of the
              few available tools in the CWS arsenal to hold the line on development in such sensitive
              undeveloped areas as significant portions of John’s Island, all of Wadmalaw Island and areas in
              the lower end of the County. Without the availability of sanitary sewer service, developers are
              greatly constrained, if not fully prohibited, from proceeding with new developments.<br><br>
              The concern, which has been in the news a lot lately, is that the developers will turn to DHEC,
              which seems much more receptive to out-of-control development, to simply seek permitting of
              dozens, or even hundreds, of septic systems. I believe that CWS has roles to play in both
              pushing back against the proliferation of septic systems and encouraging much stricter
              enforcement of the existing septic systems, while keeping in check rampant development.</p>

								<h3 class="section-headings">Environment and Sea-Level Change Planning and Management</h3>
								<p>As a native Charlestonian, I have always been a fierce advocate for the environment and all that
                  makes the Lowcountry special. In my almost twenty-four years on the Board of CWS, I have
                  placed environmental stewardship at the forefront of our priorities and the staff has made it a
                  hallmark of the operations as well. To that end, CWS has, and will continue to invest heavily in
                  infrastructure maintenance and upgrades geared towards preserving and protecting the
                  environment and clean water.<br><br>
                  Most recently, the Board has committed the resources to staff and has authorized staff to seek out
                  grant funds as well to work with other local governmental entities in an effort to transition as
                  many residents as possible in the James Island Creek/Ellis Creek watershed from aging and
                  failing septic systems to connections to the sanitary sewer systems. This effort has been
                  undertaken in a way to ensure that it does not cause financial hardship on those who are electing
                  to make the change.<br><br>
                  The Board has also committed the resources to staff necessary to improve the sewer collection
                  system in the West Ashley area in an effort to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows in tropical
                  weather and heavy rain events. The extension of the West Ashley sewer tunnel is well into the
                  advanced planning stages and there are several pump station upgrades underway, particularly in
                  the Highway 171 corridor of West Ashley.<br><br>
                  Finally, we have to continue to plan for the problems for both water and sewer infrastructure
                  presented by continued sea level rise. Through my leadership of the Board, we have given staff
                  all of the tools necessary to continue to plan and implement new construction with an eye
                  towards the impacts of the rising water. We recently completed the new customer service and
                  emergency operations facility on the campus of the Hanahan Water Treatment Plant, allowing for
                  all of our critical Information Technology infrastructure and all of the necessary emergency
                  operations infrastructure to be located in one, much higher area of the community. We need the
                  vision and commitment necessary to continue planning for other changes, and I have consistently
                  demonstrated both throughout my service.</p>

								<h3 class="section-headings">Sound Governance and Financial Excellence</h3>
								<p>I am committed to providing the proven, responsible leadership that has been the hallmark of my
                  service to the citizens of Charleston throughout my time on the CWS Board. I pride myself on
                  finding consensus among the Board members on even the most difficult of issues. We have built
                  a stable, consistent organization which lends itself to well-run board meetings and smooth
                  operation of CWS.<br><br>
                  Since I was elected to serve my first term starting in January 2000, CWS has seen its credit
                  rating with the three major bond rating agencies (Standard &amp; Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch) from
                  AA to AA+ in 2001 and from AA+ to AAA in 2010 (Standard &amp; Poor’s, 2015 Moody’s, Fitch
                  more recently), and has maintain the AAA rating continuously since that time through successive
                  credit evaluations. CWS is the only combined water and wastewater utility in the State to have
                  an AAA credit rating and one of less than three dozen in the Country. This allows CWS to
                  borrow money through bond issues at the most favorable rates possible, savings which are
                  passed on to our rate payers. As Chairman for the past seventeen-plus years, I have
                  demonstrated a commitment to the sound fiscal policies required to maintain such a healthy
                  financial position. Under my steady leadership, you can be assured that the commitment will be
                  maintained for the benefit of all citizens.</p>
